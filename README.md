# CPU Scheduling Algorithms Project

This project contains implementations of several CPU scheduling algorithms for educational purposes. The algorithms included are:

- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Non-preemptive (PNP)**

## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** version 8 or higher.
- **IDE** such as **Eclipse** or **IntelliJ IDEA**, or you can compile and run the project directly from the command line.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project on your local machine:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

You need to clone the repository to your local machine. Open a terminal or command prompt and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ma7EG/Cpu_Schduling-JAVA-beta-v0.1

## Step 2: Import into IDE
Open your preferred IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
Import the cloned project into the IDE:
In Eclipse, go to File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace, and select the project folder.
In IntelliJ IDEA, select File > Open, then navigate to the project folder and open it.
Step 3: Run the Project
To run the project:

Open the main class file: The project contains different classes for each scheduling algorithm. Make sure you run the main class for the algorithm you want to test.

Execute the program:

In Eclipse, right-click on the main class file and select Run As > Java Application.
In IntelliJ IDEA, click on the green run button (â–¶) in the top-right corner.
Step 4: User Interface
The project provides a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for interacting with the algorithms. You can enter the following parameters:

Burst Time: The time required for a process to complete.
Priority: The priority of a process (for the PNP algorithm).
Quantum: The time slice used for Round Robin scheduling.
Process ID: The unique identifier for each process.
Step 5: Algorithms and Output
Each scheduling algorithm will calculate and display the following information for each process:

Completion Time: When the process finishes.
Turnaround Time: The total time taken from arrival to completion.
Waiting Time: The time the process has been in the ready queue.
Step 6: Modify and Test
Feel free to modify the processes or parameters in the GUI to see how different inputs affect the scheduling.
